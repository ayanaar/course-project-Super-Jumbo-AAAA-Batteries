# Project Accessibility Report #

**1. Describe features that we could implement in the future that would adhere to principles.**

Principle 1: Equitable Use
*  Allow alternative input sources into our website so that users can enter input by clicking, typing, speaking into their microphone, or using some other input device.
* Implementing a text*to*speech feature in the website that can describe the prompts to the user.
* Allow user customization of the background gradient colour(s) of the website.

Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
* Making our website accessible on any browser (i.e, Safari, Google Chrome, Firefox, etc).
* The location of visual elements on the screen, their size, and how many words are associated with each one ( labels on buttons with decently sized font, drop*down menus).
* Create an easy to understand  documentation and/or "help" menu.

Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
* Create concise and meaningful error messages (i.e, when an user enters the wrong quantity or when the user enters an invalid item).
* If a user clicks the "Save" button but is unable to save the user's information, add a pop-up window with the message "Your information did not save. Please try again."

Principle 4: Perceptible Information
* Make the font on the website legible
* Use colours on the website that cater to everyone (i.e, account for colourblind individuals).
* Make a pop-up with pictures that explains key steps in using our website in addition to a help menu.
* Pop-up texts that explain what buttons do when users hover over them for users with visual impairments.


Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
* Implementing an "undo" feature on our website that allows the user to correct mistakes without any consequence (i.e, if they enter the wrong number or quantity of item).
* Warn/double-check with the user before they remove an item from their inventory/shopping list if they really want to remove that item.
* Have the user only retype the password if it is wrong instead of both the username and the password.



Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
* Implement an autocomplete option for typing items on our website so that the user can type more words with less effort.
* Allow users to add items all at once instead of adding them one by one (to avoid repetitive actions).
* Ensure that essential buttons are in ergonomic positions (i.e, the user doesn’t have to keep scrolling to find the save button or add button).

Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
* Implement high contrast colours that make the website easier to see when viewing the screen from different angles.
* Ensure that the font size for the buttons and text on the website is dark and legible when viewing the screen from different angles.


**2. Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.**

We would market our program towards people who need to stay organized and want to prevent waste while saving money, this can include students, families, or any organization. Our program allows users to manage their household inventory. At any given time a user can view everything they have in their household/inventory. They can also create shopping lists for future use. This will prevent users from over buying household items while preventing waste as they will be able to see everything they have in their home with a click of a button.

**3. Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to be used by people who do not read braille.**

Our program is less likely to be used by people who don’t need to or don’t have to buy household items and groceries. For example, people who don’t have access to an internet connection or access to a technological device because they will not be able to access _gyst_.  Additionally, children are less likely to use _gyst_ since they usually rely on their families to provide for them so they don’t need to keep track of items. Seniors and people who are not well*versed with technology may also be less likely to use our website because they are less familiar with technology and may find it very complicated to use our system.
